# Tower-3D-color
Made with Rhino7 3D
Hi !
Today, I will show again something that I done with Rhino7 ; I made a cylinder which looks like a very futurist tower. Actually, I made a color gradient, which makes my building very colored. I uploaded a .jpg file and a 3dm file, if you want to use my tower in one of your project, do not hesitate, I put a 3dm's file for this reason. I think that I will publish others projects with Rhino on my GitHub, because I really like make 3d with Python and there are so possibilities with Rhino that's just amazing. I work with Windows 10 and rpi4 with the last version of Rhino, Do not hesitate to check my code and try to run it (you have to install rhino first).

See you later !!
